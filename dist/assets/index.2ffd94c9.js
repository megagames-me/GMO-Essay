According to Amanda Cavanagh, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois, \u201CBy 2050, we\u2019re pretty certain that we have to increase crop yields by anywhere from 25 to 70 percent to feed all the hungry people in the world. We don\u2019t have another obvious way to increase yield other than taking a genetic engineering approach.\u201D Because the experiment showed a 40% increase in size in early stages, this means that it could be a feasible solution provided that it\u2019s within the 25 to 70% range. Having a higher yield from each plant would increase the total food in the world. Having more food would decrease deaths from malnutrition, and therefore, increase GMO popularity. This would increase GMOs used and repeat the cycle. All we need to do is give this reinforcing causal loop a push. Therefore, GMOs can increase our food supply."]}),e("p",{children:"Another reason that GMOs are useful is that they are actually good for the environment. According to GMO Answers, GMOs are easier to farm and require less input: \u201CA major advantage for over 18 million farmers globally who plant GMOs is the ability to successfully grow crops with fewer inputs, including reduced pesticide applications and the fuel needed to operate tractors to till the soil.\u201D This means that farming GMOs is more efficient and easier for poor farmers to farm. It\u2019s lower maintenance, and it pollutes less and the food will be more natural because there would be less pesticides in them than normal \u201Corganic\u201D foods. Funnily enough, this means that GMOs are actually better for the environment, humans, and animals than normal \u201Corganic\u201D produce. According to the scientific paper GM Crops: Global Socio-Economic and Environmental Impacts 1996-2014, GMOs helped reduce the amount of land used by farming in 2014 by 20.7 million hectares (51.2 million acres). This means that we can reduce the amount of deforestation by using GMOs, which is good for the environment because we can plant our crops and also save habitats that are being destroyed. This would be useful for palm plantations because they can use less area from natural habitats. Also, land costs money and that would mean being a farmer would be cheaper as they don\u2019t have to buy as much land. Having more efficient land usage can affect deforestation and the stakeholder of farmers provided that they will be more interested in GMOs since they can get the food cheaper. This leads to more GMO crops being produced. Just from being more land efficient, a ripple effect that ensues is fewer deaths because of increased crop production. Because of this evidence, GMOs can be good for the environment."}),e("p",{children:"Finally, GMOs can be more nutritious than conventional foods. According to the Alliance for Science article \u201CUnfairly demonized GMO crops can help fight malnutrition\u201D, \u201C [...] breeding strategies with genetic engineering can be redirected towards the accumulation of a non-existent target nutrient in a desired tissue [...] The first genetically modified (GM) crop that produced beta-carotene [precursor to Vitamin A] was rice, an important cereal that doesn\u2019t have this nutrient in its grain.\u201D This means that we can use genetic modifications to make our food healthier. To the 57%\u2014how does this make GMOs bad for us? With these modifications and modifying photosynthesis, we can decrease malnutrition, as we have more crops with more efficient delivery of nutrition. The same articles state that \u201CThere are also GM crops where several nutrients have been increased...achieving 169 times more beta-carotene, six times more vitamin C and twice as much folate.\u201D One hundred sixty-nine times is quite a lot. Practically everyone likes rice, but some people don\u2019t like the taste of leafy vegetables and liver oil. Since increased nutrition doesn\u2019t affect taste, using golden rice could help those who do not like the taste of leafy vegetables. Facilitating people\u2019s enjoyment of nutritious foods can lead to less malnutrition; people will get more nutrition, fewer people will die, and this will lead to a higher popularity of GMOs, causing more GMOs to be planted, repeating the cycle. Using all of this, we can come to the conclusion that GMOs can, in fact, be more nutritious than normal food, contrary to popular belief."}),e("p",{children:"However, someone might argue that having GMOs shifts power to companies and away from small farmers. This is a valid argument, but isn\u2019t totally true. According to the previous Alliance for Science article, many GMOs are actually royalty free, \u201C...and like golden rice, the [golden banana] will be released without royalties so that it can be cultivated freely by African farmers.\u201D Farmers in Africa would probably rather use cheaper royalty-free GMOs rather than expensive royalty-expensive GMOs. This would propagate in the system since cheaper-to-buy GMOs would drive prices down from conventional foods and GMOs with royalties would not be able to survive as they would be more expensive. This would lead to most GMOs becoming royalty free because GMO companies wouldn\u2019t survive if no one wanted to buy their products. Therefore, it\u2019s clear that GMOs won\u2019t really give power to companies."}),a("p",{children:["Now that you are (hopefully) convinced, how can you help? It\u2019s pretty easy. Stop boycotting GMOs yourself and actually buy GM foods. It will speed up the process of GMO integration into the food industry. Have any misinformed friends? Talk to them, and explain to them why. And last but not least, the most important one: spread the word by being a proponent of GMOs and taking civic action. We have to be able to feed a growing population, which includes a growing starving population. Also, these anti-GMO groups aren\u2019t as \u201Cgrassroots\u201D as you think. You may say that pro-GMO groups are funded by GMO companies. Well, anti-GMO groups are actually funded by organic food companies. See the conflict of interest? The only people supporting the anti-GMO movement are organic foods companies, and the people supporting the pro-GMO movement are both GMO companies and scientists.

Farmers buy seeds for cheaper, farmers spend less of their money and time on the growing plants, and you spend less money on the plants, you can eat less of them for more nutrition, and you can keep them in storage for longer.
